# ELE456 Final Project Simulation

This is the repository for simulation codes and results of ELE456 final project.

- The code for simulation and result visualization is in `ELE456_Kerr_simulation.ipynb`. To run the simulation Python package QuTiP is required.

- `frames_Q/` contains Q function figures at different simulation times for making the movie.

- `frames_wigner/` contains Wigner function figures at different simulation times for making the movie.

- `movies/` contains the GIF files and movies showing the evolution of Q and Wigner functions under different decay rates.

- `paper_fig/` contains figures for comparison with the results in the paper.
